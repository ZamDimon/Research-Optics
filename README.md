The goal of this application is the trajectory of light construction in an optically inhomogeneous medium knowing refractive index distribution and initial beam parameters. This program was part of my research paper "*Simulation of light propagation in an optically inhomogeneous medium*". Modelling was implemented in *C#, Unity*.

## Contents

I did not include full Unity project yet you can review all the code by visiting `Research-Optics/Scripts`. If you want to see how application works, you can check out the build by visiting `Research-Optics/Build`.
